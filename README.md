# EEG-Classification

This Project is divided into two tasks one for MI and the other for SSVEP


### Problem
#### MI
- Each trial has 1750 time step
- For each trial try to predict is the user thinking left or right.
#### SSVEP
- Each trial has 2250 time step
- For each trial try to predict is the user thinking left or right or forward or backward
### Solution
- Studied the data
- Analysed the data to see the correlation between different features
- Used relevant features that have weak correlation with other features to avoid unnecessary data
- Choosed suitable model and started training
- Alnogside training tuned the hyperparameters
